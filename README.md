# System design

## About
System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data flow of a software 
system to meet specific requirements—such as scalability, reliability, maintainability, and performance. 
In simpler terms, it’s about planning how different parts of a system will work together to solve a problem efficiently 
and effectively, especially when the system is large or expected to handle a lot of users or data.
